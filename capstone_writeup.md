# Capstone Project

## Idea

The idea for this project was to use ProPublica's Congress and Campaign Finance APIs to plot basic 
campaign finance metrics by state using an interactive Plotly map of the US. I was able to 
successfully access the two APIs and link them using the House members' FEC ID from the Congress
API. I then fed that into the Campaign Finance API and access the financial data. I created the API
and data logic for the 2016 campaign cycle. 

## 2018 election

I also created a code that runs the same numbers for the 2018 election cycle. The ProPublica 
Campaign Finance API updates every 15 minutes and thus this data is dynamic and changes on
each run.
